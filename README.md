# ArcPy Toolbox for Automating the Suitability Analysis Workflow for Selection of the Location of Residence
This project presents an automated toolbox developed using ArcGIS, designed to simplify the process of selecting the ideal residence location in Salzburg. The toolbox employs a multicriteria spatial analysis method, taking into account various environmental and service factors, including proximity to schools, parks, shopping malls, restaurants, and public transportation. Users can customize their preferences by assigning weights to criteria, allowing for a tailored selection process. While the project prioritizes technical implementation over result accuracy, it serves as a valuable tool for homebuyers and real estate agents in considering both service accessibility and environmental quality when choosing a place to reside. This open-source project showcases the potential of geospatial analysis for real-world decision-making.
